We shall create a new folder called \"python-for-ai\" to store all the material related to this course. Inside this folder, we shall crete three folders called \"data\", \"models\" and \"notebooks\". All our Jupyter notebooks will be saved into the \"notebooks\" folder. You will automatically get this folder structure if you download the course material from our [GitHub page](https://github.com/agni-data/python-for-ai). <br>\n",

    "    - Python codes are typed into the \"Cell\" and executed by either clicking on the \"Run Cell\" button, or by pressing the keyboard shortcut ```Shift``` + ```Enter```.\n",
    "    - After execution of each \"Cell\", if there is any output, it will be displayed immediately below that Cell itself and hence you can confirm if your code is working as expected.\n",
